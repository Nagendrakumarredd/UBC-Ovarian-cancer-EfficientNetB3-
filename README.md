# UBC-Ovarian-cancer-EfficientNetB3-
This project showcases the application of EfficientNetB3 in medical image analysis, specifically for ovarian cancer classification. By integrating deep learning with histopathological examination, we can enhance the diagnostic process, potentially leading to earlier detection and better patient outcomes.
