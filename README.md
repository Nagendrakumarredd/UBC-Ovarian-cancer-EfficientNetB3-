UBC-Ovarian Cancer Classification using EfficientNetB3
# Project Overview
This project aims to classify ovarian cancer histopathology images using the EfficientNetB3 model. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ovarian cancer detection, contributing to better diagnostic tools in the medical field.

# Background
Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies due to its asymptomatic nature in early stages, leading to late diagnoses. Accurate and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Histopathological image analysis is a common method used in diagnosing ovarian cancer, but it is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. Automating this process using deep learning models can assist pathologists and enhance diagnostic accuracy.

# EfficientNetB3 Model
EfficientNetB3 is a convolutional neural network architecture that balances network depth, width, and resolution for efficient and accurate image classification. Developed by Google AI, EfficientNetB3 is part of the EfficientNet family, known for its superior performance on various image recognition tasks with fewer parameters compared to other models like ResNet and Inception.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of histopathology images of ovarian cancer tissues. The images are preprocessed and augmented to increase the dataset size and variability, improving the model's generalization ability.

# Methodology
# Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented using techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming.
# Model Architecture: EfficientNetB3 architecture is implemented, leveraging its pre-trained weights on ImageNet for transfer learning.
# Training: The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
# Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Results
The EfficientNetB3 model achieved high accuracy in classifying ovarian cancer histopathology images, demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool for assisting in ovarian cancer diagnosis.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the application of EfficientNetB3 in medical image analysis, specifically for ovarian cancer classification. By integrating deep learning with histopathological examination, we can enhance the diagnostic process, potentially leading to earlier detection and better patient outcomes.
